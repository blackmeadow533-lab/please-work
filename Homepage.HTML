          <h2>About the Park</h2>
          <p>Every child should be able to go to a park and have a blast. 
            The parents should also not have to worry what their child is going to step on or if the equipment is going to brake because it isn't strong enough. 
            I know of multiple parks that would be good parks, however sketchy people hang out there and people leave evidence of their drug use or alcohol bottles all over.</p>

            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p> The next step that we need to take, so that we can repair and renew the park is to fundraise money for new equipment.</p>
            <p> We need to raise at least $45,000 dollars. There is a link down blow were you can donate. Any amount helps even if it is $1.</p>
